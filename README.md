# Data-analysis-project-in-Python
 This project aims to develop a Python program that reads a CSV file containing global population data for various countries categorized by their respective regions. The program is tasked with performing statistical analysis as follows: firstly, calculating the standard error of population for each region and determining the cosine similarity between population and land area for each region. Secondly, it creates a dictionary containing information for each region and country, including population, net change, percentage of population relative to the region, population density, and population rank within the region. This project seeks to provide an automated approach for analyzing global population data to gain insights into population distribution and characteristics across regions.
